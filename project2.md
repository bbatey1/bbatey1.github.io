Python Classes Project
===============

-   Class: Survey of Scripting Languages  
-   Grade: 100 
-   Language(s): Perl Scripting 
-   Source Code Repository: https://github.com/bbatey1/CSCI-301-code-repository/tree/master/lab04

## Project description

The goal is to practice using Perl hashes, file inout/output, and basic data processing. The script reads a text file called scores.txt, where each line contains a player's name and their bowling score. Using Perl, the program must build a has of a plyaer data, analyze the scores, and then produce three output files:

averge.txt: contains the average bowling score of all players
winners.txt contains the name of the player with the highest score.
sorted.txt contains all players listed in ascending score order.

The script performs all of these tasks by reading the file, storing data in a hash, performing calculations, and writing outputs to new files.

## How to compile and run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

Perl does not require traditional compliation the way languages like C, C++, or Java do. Perl scripts run directlythrough the Perl interpreter. To execute the lab project, you first opena  PwerShell terminal on your computer. Once the terminal open, you must navitgate to the folder where my lab04.pl file is stored. For example, if the is on your Desktop or inside the repository folder, you change into that drectory so the terminal is "inside" the same location as the script.

After you are in the correct directory, you run the script by telling the Perl interpreter to execute it. This is done by entering a command that calls the Perl program installed on your system and instructs it to process the lab04.pl file. There is no separate compile step; running the script automatically compiles and executes it in a single action. Once executed, the program reads the scores.txt file, performs the required calculations, and generates the three output files (average.txt, winner.txt, and sortecd.txt) inside the same folder.


## UI Design



 
 To avoid any issues: male sure PErl is installed correctly  and recongnized in PowerShe;;. Always run the script from the same folder that contains both the lab04.pl file and the scores.txt file. Dobule-check that filenames match exactly and that the inpute file is formatted correctly with each line containing a name and a score. Keeping the files in the right place and ensuring proper formatting rpevents almost all common eorrs

## 3. Additional Considerations

Make sure your script has permission to read amnd write files in the folder you're using. Close the files you're editing before running the program so nothing is locked. Use simple filenames without spaces to avoid unexpected errors. Finally, always save your script as plain text so the editor doesn't add hidden extensions.
