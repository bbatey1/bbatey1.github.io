## Project description

This project applies object-oriented programming in Python by designing a RightTriangle class constructed with two leg lengths. This class encapulates state using prive attributes (_sideA, _sideB) and exposes getter/setter methods that validate inputs to prevent invalid geometry. Computational methods return derived properties get_hyptenuse() computes the √(a²+b²) and get_surface_area() returns 1/2ab so no redundante state is stored. A simple test harness in main() demonstrates creating a triangle, reading values, computing results, then updating both sides and re-computing. Version control was used throughout to mirror a standard collaborative workflow.

## How to compile and run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.



No compile step since Python is interpreted. All you need to do is open a terminal in the folder with RightTriangle.py. The script isn't deployed.

## UI Design



When you run the program, it immediately executes a short demo that pronts the measurements for example right triangles: the two side lendths, the calculated hypotenuse, and the calculated surface area. It does not prompt for input; you simply launch it to view the results, verify the numbers and re-run.


 
 To avoid any hiccups: use Python 3 (3.8 or never is safest) and make sure you're running the file from its folder so the terminal's working directory is correct; if you have multiple Python versions installed, prefer pythion on Windows. If you're using macOS/Linux use python3. 

## 3. Additional Considerations

There are no external dependencies beyond the standard library, so a virtual environment is optional, but it can keep your setup clean. The program prints floating-point results, so minor decimal differences by platform are normal.
